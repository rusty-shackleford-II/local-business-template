# Image Bandwidth Protection Guide

This guide explains how to prevent crawlers and bots from running up your image bandwidth costs on sites deployed with the local-business template.

## Overview

**How Deployment Works:**
1. During deployment, images are **copied from Supabase Storage to GitHub**
2. GitHub pushes to Cloudflare Pages
3. Images are served from **Cloudflare CDN**, NOT Supabase
4. Supabase bandwidth is only used **during deployment** (one-time per deploy)
5. All visitor traffic hits Cloudflare, not Supabase ‚úÖ

This means crawler protection focuses on **Cloudflare**, not Supabase.

## ‚úÖ Already Implemented

### 1. robots.txt Configuration

The `public/robots.txt` file now includes:
- Blocks image crawlers (Googlebot-Image, Bingbot image crawlers)
- Disallows direct crawling of image file extensions
- Note: This is advisory only - malicious bots can ignore it

---

## üîß Recommended: Cloudflare Configuration

Since your sites deploy to Cloudflare Pages, you can use Cloudflare's built-in protection features:

### A. Enable Bot Fight Mode (Free)

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Bots
2. Enable "Bot Fight Mode" (on Free plan) or "Super Bot Fight Mode" (on paid plans)
3. This will challenge or block automated traffic

### B. Configure Rate Limiting

Create a rate limiting rule for images:

**Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Security ‚Üí WAF ‚Üí Rate limiting rules**

```
Rule Name: Image Bandwidth Protection
If incoming requests match:
  - URI Path contains ".jpg" OR ".jpeg" OR ".png" OR ".webp" OR ".gif"
  
Then:
  - Rate: 50 requests per 10 seconds per IP
  - Action: Block for 1 hour
  - Response: Custom HTML or CAPTCHA challenge
```

### C. Hotlink Protection

Prevent other sites from embedding your images:

**Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Scrape Shield ‚Üí Hotlink Protection**

1. Enable "Hotlink Protection"
2. This blocks requests where the Referer header doesn't match your domain

Alternative: Create a WAF rule:

```
Rule Name: Block Image Hotlinking
If incoming requests match:
  - URI Path contains ".jpg" OR ".jpeg" OR ".png" OR ".webp"
  AND
  - Referer does not contain "yourdomain.com"
  AND
  - Referer is not empty (allow direct browser access)
  
Then:
  - Action: Block
```

### D. Cache Everything with Long TTL

**Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Page Rules (or Cache Rules)**

```
URL Pattern: *.jpg, *.png, *.jpeg, *.webp, *.gif
Settings:
  - Cache Level: Cache Everything
  - Edge Cache TTL: 1 month
  - Browser Cache TTL: 1 day
```

This reduces hits to your Supabase storage (bandwidth charges).

### E. Enable Image Optimization (Pro plan or higher)

**Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Speed ‚Üí Optimization**

- Enable "Polish" (lossless/lossy compression)
- Enable "WebP" conversion for supported browsers
- This reduces bandwidth by serving smaller images

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Supabase Storage Configuration

### A. Enable RLS and Create Policies

If your images are in a public bucket, consider adding Row Level Security:

```sql
-- Create a policy that limits access rate
-- (Note: Supabase RLS doesn't have native rate limiting,
--  but you can use edge functions)
```

### B. Supabase Storage (Optional - Only Deployment Traffic)

Since images are only downloaded from Supabase **during deployment** (not visitor traffic), Supabase bandwidth protection is less critical. However, you can still:

1. **Monitor deployment frequency** - Each redeploy re-downloads all images
2. **Set Supabase usage alerts** - Get notified of unusual bandwidth spikes
3. **Use smaller images** - Reduce deployment bandwidth usage

**Note:** Visitor traffic does NOT hit Supabase, so crawler bandwidth issues are minimal here.

## üìä Recommended Configuration Tiers

### Tier 1: Basic (Free)
- ‚úÖ Updated robots.txt (done)
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Bot Fight Mode (free)
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Cache Rules (free)
- ‚úÖ Hotlink Protection (free)

**Estimated bandwidth reduction: 40-60%**

### Tier 2: Enhanced (Cloudflare Pro - $20/mo)
- All Tier 1 features
- ‚úÖ Super Bot Fight Mode
- ‚úÖ Advanced Rate Limiting
- ‚úÖ Polish image optimization
- ‚úÖ More granular WAF rules

**Estimated bandwidth reduction: 70-85%**

### Tier 3: Maximum (Cloudflare Business - $200/mo)
- All Tier 2 features
- ‚úÖ Custom SSL certificates
- ‚úÖ 100% uptime SLA
- ‚úÖ DDoS protection
- ‚úÖ Image Resizing at edge

**Estimated bandwidth reduction: 85-95%**

---

## üéØ Quick Start: Minimal Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Enable Bot Fight Mode** in Cloudflare
2. **Enable Hotlink Protection** in Cloudflare
3. **Create a Page Rule** for image caching:
   - Pattern: `*yourdomain.com/*.{jpg,jpeg,png,webp,gif}`
   - Settings: "Cache Everything" + "Edge Cache TTL: 1 month"

This will handle 90% of common crawler issues with zero code changes.

---

## üìà Monitoring

### Track bandwidth usage:

1. **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Storage
   - Monitor "Storage Usage" and "Bandwidth"
   - Set up alerts for unusual spikes

2. **Cloudflare Dashboard** ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Traffic
   - Monitor "Cached vs Uncached" ratio
   - Check "Threats" section for blocked bots

3. **Set Budget Alerts**
   - In Supabase: Project Settings ‚Üí Usage Limits
   - Set hard limits to prevent surprise charges

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### SEO Impact
- Blocking Googlebot-Image means your images won't appear in Google Image Search
- If you want images indexed but want to save bandwidth, only use rate limiting and caching
- Consider: Do you need image search traffic, or is regular web search sufficient?

### Legitimate Users
- Rate limiting should be generous enough to not affect real users
- Recommendation: 50 requests per 10 seconds per IP (very generous)
- Most legitimate users won't load 50 images in 10 seconds

### Social Media Previews
- Ensure social media crawlers can still access og:image
- Add exceptions for:
  - `facebookexternalhit`
  - `Twitterbot`
  - `LinkedInBot`
  - `WhatsApp`

Example WAF rule adjustment:
```
If:
  - (URI contains image extensions)
  AND
  - User-Agent does NOT contain "facebookexternalhit|Twitterbot|LinkedInBot|WhatsApp"
Then:
  - Apply rate limit
```

---

## üîç Debugging

If legitimate users report issues:

1. Check Cloudflare Firewall Events
   - Security ‚Üí Security Events
   - Filter by action "Block" or "Challenge"
   - Look for false positives

2. Temporarily disable rules one by one
3. Adjust rate limits or add exceptions
4. Monitor for 24-48 hours

## üí° Alternative: Serve Critical Images Only

Another approach is to reduce the number of images loaded:

1. **Lazy load everything** (already implemented via Next.js Image)
2. **Use progressive JPEG** for hero images
3. **Serve WebP with JPEG fallback**
4. **Limit image dimensions** in site.json generation
5. **Use placeholders** for less critical images

This is implemented in the template's `IdbImage.tsx` component, which already handles lazy loading and progressive loading.
